            <h2>Is This You?</h2>
            <p>You're a Director of Sales at a premier hospitality venue, and you know automation is the future. But right now, the reality feels different.</p>
            
            <ul style="margin-left: var(--spacing-md); line-height: 2; font-size: 1.1rem;">
                <li>Your team is <strong>drowning in administrative tasks</strong>, manually entering data instead of building relationships and closing high-value deals.</li>
                <li>You're concerned that <strong>six-figure event inquiries are going cold</strong> because your response time is measured in hours, not minutes.</li>
                <li>Your expensive new CRM feels more like a <strong>data-entry chore than a sales asset</strong>, and adoption is a constant battle.</li>
                <li>You're skeptical that "AI" can deliver real ROI without <strong>sacrificing the personal touch</strong> that defines great hospitality.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If this sounds familiar, you're not alone. The gap between AI hype and operational reality is the single biggest challenge for growth-focused hospitality leaders today.</p>
