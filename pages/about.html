    <!-- OUR STORY -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Our Story: The Search for Practical AI</h2>
            <p>VeriAura was founded from a simple observation: too many businesses were being sold the <em>dream</em> of AI but were left struggling with the <em>reality</em>. We saw brilliant sales teams in the hospitality industry—experts in human connection—getting bogged down by clunky software and automation that created more problems than it solved. The market was flooded with hype, but practical, human-centered solutions were missing.</p>
            <p>We knew there had to be a better way. We envisioned a consulting practice that prioritized strategy over software and people over platforms. A firm that would reject the "move fast and break things" mentality in favor of a calmer, more structured approach. VeriAura was born not to chase the next big trend, but to make today's technology work for real businesses, delivering systems that are as reliable and intuitive as your best people.</p>

            <h2>Meet Luiza, Founder & Principal Strategist</h2>
            <p>With a foundation in engineering and five years spent building enterprise-grade solutions for some of the world's top corporations, Luiza developed a clear and powerful perspective: technology is only valuable when it produces a measurable business outcome. It was this principle that inspired the creation of VeriAura.</p>
            <p>During her time in the tech industry, she learned that while tools and platforms are temporary, a focus on ROI is timeless. Luiza founded VeriAura to move beyond the hype and provide clients with practical, results-driven AI strategies. As a leader, she specializes in navigating the human side of technological change, ensuring that new systems empower teams and minimize disruption. Her approach is built on the belief that the most successful automation is not just about what you build, but how your people adopt it.</p>
            <p>Based in Canada, Luiza is a wife and a mother to two active boys. When she isn't designing human-centered AI systems, she can be found enjoying the outdoors with her family, even in the depths of a Canadian winter.</p>
